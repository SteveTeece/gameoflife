## What is this? 

This is a web-based implementation of [Conway's Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life) built on the .NET web stack.

## Why?

The sole purpose of this project is to be *sandbox* to try out whatever library, language or technique that interests me at the moment. If a given experiment turns out well, I'll usually keep the implementation for future reference.

Right now I'm using:

 - [Microsoft ASP.NET Web Api 4.0](http://www.asp.net/web-api)
 - [KnockoutJS](http://knockoutjs.com)
 - [jQuery](http://jquery.com)

## How is it being developed?

The entire application is developed using [Behavior-driven development (BDD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) style testing from the acceptance tests down to the unit test level.
